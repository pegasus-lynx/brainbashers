### BrainBashers : Puzzles Solver

Let's solve BrainBashers puzzles using code.

**What is BrainBashers ?**
BrainBashers is a website which hosts various puzzles, brainteasers and illusions. There are a lot of puzzles like : Bridges, Daily Networks, Net Slide, Calc Sudoku, etc. which are really fun to solve. Visit yourself and take a look at this amazing website : []().

I have been doing these puzzles for a while now, and thought let's go and write some code to solve these, and that's the reason this repository exists.

As of now, we have only one project `BridgeBot` which is meant to solve the Bridge puzzle.
